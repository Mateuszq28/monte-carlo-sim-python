local attenuation coefficient of the medium
At the end of each photon
step, the weight of the photon is reduced by absorption

The remaining non-absorbed
weight is redirected according to a scattering (or “phase”) function that describes
the angular dependence of single scattering by the particular tissue

photon path, absorption, scattering, reflection, and refraction

The heat generated, S [W/cm3 ], within a small
volume depends upon the total photon weight absorbed in the volume, the total
number of photons, and power of the laser beam
